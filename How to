How I set it up.

WSL: Installing Necessary Tools such as gcc for compling gdb for debudding and python3 for the scripting in my WSL
Using script named 'exploit_1.sh' that I will attempts to overflow the buffer.
I am going to use Python to generate a long string and pass it to as an argument to the C program
